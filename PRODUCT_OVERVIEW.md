## Core Features

### 1. **Market Research: Discover Your Ideal Customers**

Instead of spending weeks searching for potential buyers, our AI finds them for you automatically.

**What you do:**
- Select 1-3 target industries (e.g., "Automotive Seating", "Food Processing Equipment", "Construction Machinery")
- Choose a target country (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, etc.)
- Specify if you want manufacturers or all types of companies

**What we do:**
The AI executes a sophisticated 6-stage research process:

1. **Industry Analysis**: Takes your selected industries and validates them as research targets
2. **Use Case Generation**: Identifies 9-15 specific products/applications that would need your offerings
3. **Intelligent Query Creation**: Generates 75-120 highly targeted search queries in the local language, using proven patterns to find real companies (not marketplaces or job boards)
4. **Search Execution**: Runs all searches in parallel through advanced search APIs, collecting company information from across the web
5. **Company Extraction**: Identifies unique companies, removes duplicates across different domains (e.g., recognizing bosch.de and bosch.com as the same company)
6. **AI Evaluation**: Each company is scored 0-100 based on how well they match your business, considering product alignment, strategic fit, and potential order value

**What you get:**
- A scored list of 50-200+ potential customers
- Each company includes:
  - Match score (0-100) showing how good a fit they are
  - Company size (Small/Medium/Large)
  - Industries and products they work with
  - Website and contact information
  - Detailed explanation of why they're a good fit for you
  - All information translated into Turkish

**The information advantage:**
Our search strategy uses 5 different discovery patterns:
- Legal/official presence (finding companies through business registration pages)
- Technical specificity (finding manufacturer websites with product catalogs)
- LinkedIn company profiles (discovering mid-sized companies with weaker SEO)
- Industry associations and trade shows (finding established players)
- Certifications and standards (finding quality-focused manufacturers)

This multi-angle approach ensures you discover companies that traditional searches would miss.

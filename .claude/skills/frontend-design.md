This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

## Implementation Rules

### Stack
- MUST use Tailwind CSS defaults unless custom values already exist or are explicitly requested
- MUST use motion/react (formerly framer-motion) when JavaScript animation is required
- SHOULD use tw-animate-css for entrance and micro-animations in Tailwind CSS
- MUST use cn utility (clsx + tailwind-merge) for class logic

### Components
- MUST use accessible component primitives for anything with keyboard or focus behavior (Base UI, React Aria, Radix)
- MUST use the project's existing component primitives first
- NEVER mix primitive systems within the same interaction surface
- SHOULD prefer Base UI for new primitives if compatible with the stack
- MUST add an aria-label to icon-only buttons
- NEVER rebuild keyboard or focus behavior by hand unless explicitly requested

### Interaction
- MUST use an AlertDialog for destructive or irreversible actions
- SHOULD use structural skeletons for loading states
- NEVER use h-screen, use h-dvh
- MUST respect safe-area-inset for fixed elements
- MUST show errors next to where the action happens
- NEVER block paste in input or textarea elements

### Animation
- NEVER add animation unless it is explicitly requested
- MUST animate only compositor props (transform, opacity)
- NEVER animate layout properties (width, height, top, left, margin, padding)
- SHOULD avoid animating paint properties (background, color) except for small, local UI (text, icons)
- SHOULD use ease-out on entrance
- NEVER exceed 200ms for interaction feedback
- MUST pause looping animations when off-screen
- SHOULD respect prefers-reduced-motion
- NEVER introduce custom easing curves unless explicitly requested
- SHOULD avoid animating large images or full-screen surfaces

### Typography
- MUST use text-balance for headings and text-pretty for body/paragraphs
- MUST use tabular-nums for data
- SHOULD use truncate or line-clamp for dense UI
- NEVER modify letter-spacing (tracking-*) unless explicitly requested

### Layout
- MUST use a fixed z-index scale (no arbitrary z-*)
- SHOULD use size-* for square elements instead of w-* + h-*

### Performance
- NEVER animate large blur() or backdrop-filter surfaces
- NEVER apply will-change outside an active animation
- NEVER use useEffect for anything that can be expressed as render logic

### Design
- NEVER use gradients unless explicitly requested
- NEVER use purple or multicolor gradients
- NEVER use glow effects as primary affordances
- SHOULD use Tailwind CSS default shadow scale unless explicitly requested
- MUST give empty states one clear next action
- SHOULD limit accent color usage to one per view
- SHOULD use existing theme or Tailwind CSS color tokens before introducing new ones

Concise rules for building accessible, fast, delightful UIs. Use MUST/SHOULD/NEVER to guide decisions.

## Interactions

### Keyboard

- MUST: Full keyboard support per [WAI-ARIA APG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/)
- MUST: Visible focus rings (`:focus-visible`; group with `:focus-within`)
- MUST: Manage focus (trap, move, return) per APG patterns
- NEVER: `outline: none` without visible focus replacement

### Targets & Input

- MUST: Hit target ≥24px (mobile ≥44px); if visual <24px, expand hit area
- MUST: Mobile `<input>` font-size ≥16px to prevent iOS zoom
- NEVER: Disable browser zoom (`user-scalable=no`, `maximum-scale=1`)
- MUST: `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent double-tap zoom
- SHOULD: Set `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` to match design

### Forms

- MUST: Hydration-safe inputs (no lost focus/value)
- NEVER: Block paste in `<input>`/`<textarea>`
- MUST: Loading buttons show spinner and keep original label
- MUST: Enter submits focused input; in `<textarea>`, ⌘/Ctrl+Enter submits
- MUST: Keep submit enabled until request starts; then disable with spinner
- MUST: Accept free text, validate after—don't block typing
- MUST: Allow incomplete form submission to surface validation
- MUST: Errors inline next to fields; on submit, focus first error
- MUST: `autocomplete` + meaningful `name`; correct `type` and `inputmode`
- SHOULD: Disable spellcheck for emails/codes/usernames
- SHOULD: Placeholders end with `…` and show example pattern
- MUST: Warn on unsaved changes before navigation
- MUST: Compatible with password managers & 2FA; allow pasting codes
- MUST: Trim values to handle text expansion trailing spaces
- MUST: No dead zones on checkboxes/radios; label+control share one hit target

### State & Navigation

- MUST: URL reflects state (deep-link filters/tabs/pagination/expanded panels)
- MUST: Back/Forward restores scroll position
- MUST: Links use `<a>`/`<Link>` for navigation (support Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click)
- NEVER: Use `<div onClick>` for navigation

### Feedback

- SHOULD: Optimistic UI; reconcile on response; on failure rollback or offer Undo
- MUST: Confirm destructive actions or provide Undo window
- MUST: Use polite `aria-live` for toasts/inline validation
- SHOULD: Ellipsis (`…`) for options opening follow-ups ("Rename…") and loading states ("Loading…")

### Touch & Drag

- MUST: Generous targets, clear affordances; avoid finicky interactions
- MUST: Delay first tooltip; subsequent peers instant
- MUST: `overscroll-behavior: contain` in modals/drawers
- MUST: During drag, disable text selection and set `inert` on dragged elements
- MUST: If it looks clickable, it must be clickable

### Autofocus

- SHOULD: Autofocus on desktop with single primary input; rarely on mobile

## Animation

- MUST: Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (provide reduced variant or disable)
- SHOULD: Prefer CSS > Web Animations API > JS libraries
- MUST: Animate compositor-friendly props (`transform`, `opacity`) only
- NEVER: Animate layout props (`top`, `left`, `width`, `height`)
- NEVER: `transition: all`—list properties explicitly
- SHOULD: Animate only to clarify cause/effect or add deliberate delight
- SHOULD: Choose easing to match the change (size/distance/trigger)
- MUST: Animations interruptible and input-driven (no autoplay)
- MUST: Correct `transform-origin` (motion starts where it "physically" should)
- MUST: SVG transforms on `<g>` wrapper with `transform-box: fill-box`

## Layout

- SHOULD: Optical alignment; adjust ±1px when perception beats geometry
- MUST: Deliberate alignment to grid/baseline/edges—no accidental placement
- SHOULD: Balance icon/text lockups (weight/size/spacing/color)
- MUST: Verify mobile, laptop, ultra-wide (simulate ultra-wide at 50% zoom)
- MUST: Respect safe areas (`env(safe-area-inset-*)`)
- MUST: Avoid unwanted scrollbars; fix overflows
- SHOULD: Flex/grid over JS measurement for layout

## Content & Accessibility

- SHOULD: Inline help first; tooltips last resort
- MUST: Skeletons mirror final content to avoid layout shift
- MUST: `<title>` matches current context
- MUST: No dead ends; always offer next step/recovery
- MUST: Design empty/sparse/dense/error states
- SHOULD: Curly quotes (" "); avoid widows/orphans (`text-wrap: balance`)
- MUST: `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for number comparisons
- MUST: Redundant status cues (not color-only); icons have text labels
- MUST: Accessible names exist even when visuals omit labels
- MUST: Use `…` character (not `...`)
- MUST: `scroll-margin-top` on headings; "Skip to content" link; hierarchical `<h1>`–`<h6>`
- MUST: Resilient to user-generated content (short/avg/very long)
- MUST: Locale-aware dates/times/numbers (`Intl.DateTimeFormat`, `Intl.NumberFormat`)
- MUST: Accurate `aria-label`; decorative elements `aria-hidden`
- MUST: Icon-only buttons have descriptive `aria-label`
- MUST: Prefer native semantics (`button`, `a`, `label`, `table`) before ARIA
- MUST: Non-breaking spaces: `10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘&nbsp;K`, brand names

## Content Handling

- MUST: Text containers handle long content (`truncate`, `line-clamp-*`, `break-words`)
- MUST: Flex children need `min-w-0` to allow truncation
- MUST: Handle empty states—no broken UI for empty strings/arrays

## Performance

- SHOULD: Test iOS Low Power Mode and macOS Safari
- MUST: Measure reliably (disable extensions that skew runtime)
- MUST: Track and minimize re-renders (React DevTools/React Scan)
- MUST: Profile with CPU/network throttling
- MUST: Batch layout reads/writes; avoid reflows/repaints
- MUST: Mutations (`POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`) target <500ms
- SHOULD: Prefer uncontrolled inputs; controlled inputs cheap per keystroke
- MUST: Virtualize large lists (>50 items)
- MUST: Preload above-fold images; lazy-load the rest
- MUST: Prevent CLS (explicit image dimensions)
- SHOULD: `<link rel="preconnect">` for CDN domains
- SHOULD: Critical fonts: `<link rel="preload" as="font">` with `font-display: swap`

## Dark Mode & Theming

- MUST: `color-scheme: dark` on `<html>` for dark themes
- SHOULD: `<meta name="theme-color">` matches page background
- MUST: Native `<select>`: explicit `background-color` and `color` (Windows fix)

## Hydration

- MUST: Inputs with `value` need `onChange` (or use `defaultValue`)
- SHOULD: Guard date/time rendering against hydration mismatch

## Design

- SHOULD: Layered shadows (ambient + direct)
- SHOULD: Crisp edges via semi-transparent borders + shadows
- SHOULD: Nested radii: child ≤ parent; concentric
- SHOULD: Hue consistency: tint borders/shadows/text toward bg hue
- MUST: Accessible charts (color-blind-friendly palettes)
- MUST: Meet contrast—prefer [APCA](https://apcacontrast.com/) over WCAG 2
- MUST: Increase contrast on `:hover`/`:active`/`:focus`
- SHOULD: Match browser UI to bg
- SHOULD: Avoid dark color gradient banding (use background images when needed)
